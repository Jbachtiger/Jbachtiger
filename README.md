## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John. A Junior Software Developer from sunny Worthing (near Brighton), UK.

I am currently studying a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net) to become proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies. The technologies I am learning and skills I am building on include: 

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and jQuery. 
- Integrated Development Environment + Testing 
- UI/UX Design + Design Thinking 
- Bootstrap, Flask, Jest, Django Frameworks 
- Database Management System (DBMS).

I originally trained as a digital marketer, however, decided to take the plunge and re-skill in an area that I find extremely interesting and compelling. Having worked within the marketing industry for 9 years, I have many transferable skills which I feel will put me in good stead in my journey as a Full Stack Software Developer. I am a focused individual who is detailed orientated and a problem-solver. I have excellent interpersonal skills, which has allowed me to thrive in my previous team-based working environments. I am an experienced results-driven and creative digital marketing specialist who is used to working with agencies and developers on projects and am commerically aware.

ðŸ‘€ I want to be ... a programmer!

After much reflection and exploration outside my comfort zone, I decided to finally go for it in November 2021 and start my journey towards becoming a Full Stack Software Developer. I have also been interested in coding and the tech industry, having dabbled in HTML and CSS in my various marketing roles previously which was the aspect of the job I enjoyed the most. I hope to broaden my knowledge and skill set, widening my understanding of programming languages.  

A little bit more about me...

In my spare time I enjoy seeing friends and family, playing video games as well as board games. I enjoy the team working, problem solving and challenging aspects of games. I also love to visit the local cinema, the theatre and the local planetarium. I enjoy when creativity and technology come together to better our lives.
